TODO: [FE] update GeoIdex with similarity approach

TODO: [FS] Decide number of features
TODO: [FS] try to rely on tree based estimator for interpretable selection judgements

        * Embedding: CNN
            * event tuple: 300 * 3
                * 3 channels, each for one of S,R,O // (3,1,300)
                * OR reshape as 2D matrix of (300,3), then refer to handling image with CNN

## Idea

* see word embeddings as image -> sequence of images ?
    * sort them by sim?
    * make alignment like doing so in CV?

## Findings

```
DIFF & Scale:
* features and label must be diff and scaled

DONE: [FS] Use ACF and Granger before shifting
    * ACF can be used to determine lag order to shift
    * Granger seems good for FS, now it is slightly better than RFE(Ridge, 60)
* InfluxDB: use tag

Done: apply VAR (statsmodels) for lag order selection instead of using Granger
    * {'aic': 9, 'bic': 4, 'hqic': 4, 'fpe': 9}

### scaling of data (esp embedding)
* for linear model, scaling embedding is better
* for DL model, the original embedding (w/o) scaling is better
* if the embedding is further aggregated as a single series (i.e. no longer embedding but a series), no big difference of scaling

### emb sequence
* better than single

### scaling
* scaling is fine, but the range should be large enough to represent feature (1-100 is better than 0.1-1)
* seems scaling also help feature selection (esp entropy)
```
